PokemonAnalysis
===============
A work in progress

I am using JSP to create a website to use as the interface for the program.

I initialize my pokemon data by scraping two different websites.

The analysis class can find the weaknesses and resistances of a single pokemon or a team of pokemon, and it can return the types that a list of attacking types would be strong against.

Plans for the future
- Improving the website's design and functionality.
- New forms of analysis.
